## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is a coding challenge from Frontend Mentor, where the task is to build an interactive rating component based on the provided design.

## Challenge Description
The challenge requires building an interactive rating component that allows users to select a rating from 1 to 5 stars. The component should have hover states for interactive elements and display a "Thank you" card after submitting a rating.

## Technologies Used
HTML

CSS

JavaScript


## How to Use
Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.

Open the project folder and navigate to the root directory.

Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the interactive rating component.

Interact with the component by hovering over the stars and selecting a rating.

After selecting a rating and clicking the "SUBMIT" button, you will be redirected to the "Thank you" page (thankyou.html), where the selected rating will be displayed.

## Folder Structure
The project contains the following files and directories:

**index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the interactive rating component.

**thankyou.html**: The HTML file for the "Thank you" page.
**styles.css**: The CSS file that styles the interactive rating component.
**rating.js**: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the rating component.
**thankyou.js**: The JavaScript file that displays the selected rating on the "Thank you" page.
**images/**: A directory that contains the image assets used in the project.
**design/**: A directory that contains the design preview image and style guide.

## Design Previews and Style Guide
The project includes a design preview image (desktop-preview.jpg) and a style guide (style-guide.md) inside the design/ directory. These resources provide guidance on how the final component should look and the colors/fonts to be used.

Feel free to customize the component's styles in the styles.css file to match the design as closely as possible.
